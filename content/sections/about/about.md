I'm from Venezuela and I started programming a little over a year and a half ago thanks to platzi ðŸ’š.

I'm currently studying systems engineering online. My most recent projects are with the react library in conjunction with the gatsby framework (this portfolio is made precisely with these technologies). I'm also learning backend with nodeJS.

Apart from these technologies based on JavaScript, I also have knowledge in data management and scraping with python and MVC in php.
